# Gunspeak-in-America_an_NLP_Project
NLP Project at Metis about Gun Violence
This repository is comprised of an NLP project exploring discussions of gun violence. The project began with a question, can we gauge the thought process and attitude 
of people towards guns by looking at the overall language used at any given moment? In an attempt to answer this I gathered data from Twitter before, during and after
a major gun violence incident. For the purposes of this project I chose to focus on the Vegas concert shooting which made major headlines in 2017. I began by utilizng
Twint to extract tweets from September, the first week of October (when the shooting occurred) and December. One of my initial discoveries before even diving into the 
language of the tweets was that the quantity of tweets mentioning guns/gun violence in the single week of October was equal to all of December. After lemmatizing and 
filtering out the tweets using various stop words NMF and Kmeans models were created to identify topics.
